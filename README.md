### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently mostly working on [CICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CICS), and looking for excuses to use comashes[^1], semi-colashes[^2] and colashes[^3] more often.

[^1]: Comash
    ```
    ,â€”
    ```

[^2]: Semi-colash
    ```
    ;â€”
    ```

[^3]: Colash
    ```
    :â€”
    ```
